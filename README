                Bayes-GLib - Bayesian Classification for GLib
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a simple attempt at making a classifier that can be used to train and
learn about data used within a given domain. It exists mostly so that I can
learn how to write a Bayesian classifier. Alternatively, it might prove useful
to be able to use the same classification API from multiple languages through
the powerful use of GObject Introspection.
